# Classification_probabiliste_heart-disease-Cleveland-database- (LU3IN005 - Stat&Info)
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers The `target` field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting champs definition

Notre but est donc de proposer des classifieurs qui tentent de prédire la valeur de target à partir
des autres champs en utilisant des arguments probabilistes.
